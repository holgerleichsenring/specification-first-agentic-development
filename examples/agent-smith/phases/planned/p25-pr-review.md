# Phase 25: PR Review Iteration

## Goal

Agent Smith reads PR review comments, makes changes, pushes new commits.
The PR becomes a conversation, not a one-shot.

## Flow

```
Ticket -> Plan -> Execute -> Test -> Create PR -> Monitor
                                                    |
Reviewer comments -> Agent reads -> Plans changes -> Executes ->
Tests -> Pushes commit -> Replies to comments -> Back to Monitor
(until approved or max iterations)
```

## Requirements

### Step 1: PR Review Listener

New method on `ISourceProvider`:

```csharp
Task<IReadOnlyList<ReviewComment>> GetPullRequestReviewsAsync(
    string pullRequestId, CancellationToken ct);
```

`ReviewComment` record: Id, Author, Body, FilePath?, LineNumber?, CreatedAt.

Implement for GitHub (Octokit), GitLab (MR notes API), Azure DevOps (PR threads).

### Step 2: Review Feedback Pipeline

Mini-pipeline: `FetchReviews -> AnalyzeReviews -> PlanRevisions -> Execute -> Test -> PushCommit -> ReplyToReviews`

- `AnalyzeReviews` classifies: actionable / question / approval / nit
- `PlanRevisions` scoped to review feedback only
- `PushCommit` new commit on existing branch (not new PR)
- `ReplyToReviews` posts reply to each addressed comment

### Step 3: Trigger Mechanisms

1. **Webhook**: `pull_request_review` event -> review pipeline
2. **Slack**: "fix PR comments on #58" -> review pipeline
3. **Polling** (fallback): configurable interval

### Step 4: Guardrails

- Max review iterations: configurable, default 3
- Only act on comments from authorized reviewers (configurable)
- Skip approvals and emoji reactions
- If comment unclear: ask for clarification via reply
- Never force-push -- always add commits

## Architecture

- `ReviewComment` record in Domain
- `IReviewAnalyzer` in Contracts
- `ReviewPipelineExecutor` in Application (reuses existing Execute/Test steps)
- Source provider extensions: `GetPullRequestReviewsAsync`, `ReplyToReviewAsync`
- New webhook event type in WebhookListener
- Config: `review.max_iterations`, `review.authorized_reviewers`, `review.polling_interval`
